Professional Experience
--------------------

Since Feb 2017
:   *Postdoctoral Researcher at Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian*
    (Cambridge, MA)

    Worked on many diverse research projects at the intersection of Astronomy,
    Chemistry, and Data Science with Dr. Michael McCarthy. The general theme of
    my research has been on investigating the role of chemistry in
    astrophysical processes, and developing novel methods for automating data
    analysis. Over the last three years, I have __published 21 peer-reviewed
    articles__ in high-impact journals. Three of my most recent projects
    include:

    - Identification of unknown molecules using probabilistic deep learning models
      - Developed high performance, probabilistic neural network architectures that infer stochiometries and functionalization in unknown molecules.
    - [Accuracy and uncertainty benchmarking of quantum chemical methods with Bayesian methods.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpca.9b09982)
      - Determined systematic uncertainties with low-cost electronic structure theory using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo models.
    - [Developed open-source tools for analyzing broadband spectral data](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.9b00586)
      - Developed [Python library](https://laserkelvin.github.io/PySpecTools/) that helps manage analysis of rotational
      spectra consisting of hundreds of spectral features, and up to 100
      distinct species.

    I also actively took part in promoting programming literacy and mentoring
    programs, particularly with the NSF funded Latino Initiative. Each summer,
    I teach a workshop on reproducibile scientific workflows and coding
    practices in Python. I have also mentored four graduate students working on
    various projects in the laboratory, which have allowed me to build my
    leadership skills.

    Over the last three years, I have played an active role in securing public
    funding; I am co-investigator on grants from the Smithsonian Institution
    and National Science Foundation worth over $500,000.

Aug 2016-Feb 2017
:   *Postdoctoral Researcher at University of New South Wales*
    (Kable group - Sydney, Australia)

    Researched the photochemistry of atmospheric molecules using a combination
    of laser spectroscopy and velocity-mapped ion imaging techniques; how molecules
    in the atmosphere are destroyed by light. Part of my responsibilities included
    maintenance of ns-laser systems and high vacuum equipment, as well as preparation
    of manuscripts for publication. I also developed several Python tools for automated
    analysis of ion images and for analyzing trajectory simulations of chemical reactions.

Mar 2013-Aug 2016
:   *PhD in Chemistry at University of New South Wales*
    (Sydney, Australia)

    Researched how molecules (pollutants) undergo photodissociation in
    the atmosphere; particularly acetone and nitrous oxide. Over the course
    of my PhD, I published four articles in major peer-reviewed journals.
    As part of my studies, I developed skills in academic/report writing,
    reproducible workflows in Python, and the operation of lasers and high
    vacuum equipment.

    Over the course of my PhD studies, I presented my work at six international
    conferences, and won two early-career researcher awards. During this
    time I also worked as a Postgraduate Teaching Fellow, where I taught
    undergraduate tutorials.
