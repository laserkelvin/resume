Profile
-------

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where I work on projects at the intersection of data science,
chemistry, astronomy, and machine learning. I apply my broad set of skills and
knowledge to identify and answer big questions, ranging from planet and star
formation to analysis automation using artificial intelligence. To date, I have
co-authored 35 publications in major peer-reviewed journals on these topics, as a lead
author, as part of a large team, and as a principal investigator and mentor.
